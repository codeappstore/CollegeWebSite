                            <p>Forests are the most significant part of natural resources. Specially, the forests are our greatest property as the Nepali saying goes, "Hariyo ban, Nepal ko dhan". Forestry is the science of planting, managing, maintaining as well as conversing forests and its related resources. Due to the careless cut down of trees, gradual disappearance of forests and competing demands on the resources, the field of forestry has a good potential for employment in the coming years. They can find jobs at places such as educational institutions, forest service companies, food companies, biotechnology firms, plant health inspection service companies, biological supply houses and so on.</p>
